# Prodigy_Internship
Here's a draft README file based on the content of your Jupyter notebook `INT_TASK_5.ipynb`. This assumes the notebook is related to machine learning tasks—specifically classification using SVMs and other models. Let me know if you'd like this customized further.

# 📘 INT\_TASK\_5 - Classification using SVM and Machine Learning Models

## 📄 Description

This notebook presents an end-to-end pipeline for classification using machine learning algorithms. The core focus is on applying Support Vector Machines (SVM) to a given dataset, including preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The notebook also includes other classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees for comparative analysis.
